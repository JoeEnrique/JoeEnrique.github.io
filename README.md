Portfolio
> Version 0.4

This is will be my future Online Portfolio. Is under construction but the general public can visit and have an opportunity to consider my work style.

Right now I am a student at MIT.
The best and the only one Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

This could be considered as a timeline history of my work. This is my very first work studying here.
I feel like a guy that wins the lottery!
