Project Name: Jose Figueroa Portfolio.  

Description: This is will be my future Online Portfolio. Is under construction but the general public can visit and have an opportunity to consider my work style.

Installation: n/a

Usage: Right now everybody that verify this page periodically will see the updates done week by week. This could be considered as a timeline history of my work. This is my very first work studying here. I feel like a guy that wins the lottery!

Support: Jose Figueroa 

Roadmap:  I am a student at MIT. The best and the only one Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
